# Three Dimensional Analysis of Phototactic Algae

This Python project performs a three-dimensional analysis of phototactic algae by analysing trajectory data and calculating curvature and torsion.

## Features

- Calculates curvature using Frenet-Serret apparatus: curvature K=(dT/ds)/N and K=|dT/ds|
- Calculates torsion using the formula: -|dB/ds|/|N|

## Dependencies

The project has minimal dependencies, requiring only:

- Python
- NumPy
- Math
- Matplotlib

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone  https://github.com/nettie168/Three-Dimensional-Analysis-of-Phototactic-Algae.git
